       <h3> What Allows Child Marriage To Occur in America? </h3>
       <p>
         One of the reasons behind child marriage in America is state laws that allow minors to wed.   For example, in many states, minors as young as sixteen may marry with the parental consent of at least one parent.  Such laws are loopholes that force children to marry young.
