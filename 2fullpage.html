    <h3> <strong> Effects of child marriage on Child Brides. </strong> </h3>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li> 
        <strong>Child marriage is a form of gender-based violence for girls. </strong></br>
           Girls married before the age of 18 are at an increased risk of
facing physical and mental abuse. The greater the age difference is
between a girl and her husband, the higher the chance it is that she
will face sexual violence. According to a 2017 report from the
Tahirih Justice Center, studies show that US women who married
  as children face higher rates of psychiatric disorders and
are more likely to receive health aid. Women who are married as children are also more likely to go through serious medical problems.
      </li>
      <li> 
      <p>
        <strong>Child marriage strips girls of their education: </strong> <br> 
      Girls who marry as children are 50% more likely to drop out of school 
and four times less likely to graduate college. A child bride's education 
will be cut down after marriage, and because of this, her work opportunities 
are limited. The wide gender gap in education and the workforce is a consequence of the limited education and work opportunities that come with child marriage. 
      </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
       <p>
          <strong>Child marriage traps girls in a chain of poverty: </strong> <br> Marrying before the age of 18 traps child brides in a cycle of poverty. 
            Between 70-80% of marriages before the age of 18 ends in divorce, and according to a   2017 report from the Tahirih Justice Center, for teen mothers, 
            getting married young and then divorcing can more than double the chance of living in poverty.   Early marriage can disrupt or discontinue a girl's 
            education and therefore limit her job opportunities ( which affects the gender balance in colleges and the workforce.) 
and gives a woman who marries young a higher chance of living in poverty when she is older than her counterparts who marry as adults.
