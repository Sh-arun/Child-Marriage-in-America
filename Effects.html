<strong> Child Marriage negatively affects minors in various ways.  It is girls who are affected the most when married as children.  Here are a few ways in which girls are affected by child marriage:

      <ol> 
        <li> <strong>Child marriage is a form of gender-based violence for girls. </strong></br>Girls married before the age of 18 are at an increased risk of</br>
facing physical and mental abuse. The greater the age difference is</br>
between a girl and her husband, the higher the chance it is that she</br>
will face sexual violence. According to a 2017 report from the</br>
Tahirih Justice Center, studies show that US women who married</br>
  as children face higher rates of psychiatric disorders and </br>
are more likely to receive health aid. Women who are married as children are </br> also more likely to go through serious medical problems.</li>
              &nbsp; 
        <li> <strong>Child marriage strips girls of their education: </strong> <br> 
      Girls who marry as children are 50% more likely to drop out of school <br>
and four times less likely to graduate college. A child bride's education <br>
will be cut down after marriage, and because of this, her work opportunities <br>
are limited. The wide gender gap in education and the workforce is a consequence <br>of the limited education and work opportunities that come with child marriage.Â    
        </li>
              &nbsp; 
        <li> <strong>Child marriage traps girls in a chain of poverty: </strong> <br> Marrying before the age of 18 traps child brides in a cycle of poverty.  Between </br> 70-80% of marriages before the age of 18 ends in divorce, and according to a  </br> 2017 report from the Tahirih Justice Center, for teen mothers, getting married  </br> young and then divorcing can more than double the chance of living in poverty.  </br> Early marriage can disrupt or discontinue a girl's education and therefore limit  </br> her job opportunities ( which affects the gender balance in colleges and the workforce.)  </br> and gives a woman who marries young a higher chance of living in poverty when she  </br> is older than her counterparts who marry as adults. </li>
